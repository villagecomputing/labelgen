LLMs can make your treasure trove of unstructured data useful if only you could transform it into structured, or extract key fields from it. Today, building LLM-powered pipelines is difficult because LLMs are unpredictable. Unlike traditional software, you can't simply write unit and integration tests that confirm the correctness of your code.

With LLMs you need a different approach: you need to evaluate your code on a dataset, and tune the code to find the right tradeoff between:

- Accuracy
- Cost
- Latency

SuperPipe is an extremely lightweight framework that helps you build these pipelines such that you can:

- Easily run them on a dataset (not just a single data point)
- Keep track of token usage, cost and latency
- Evaluate accuracy against ground truth
- Evaluate the correctness of each step in the pipeline
- Easily parametrize each step (eg. model choice) so you can tune the parameters to optimize performance

## Get Started

Installing SuperPipe is a breeze. Simply run `pip install superpipe-py` in your terminal.
