# Superpipe - build, evaluate and optimize LLM pipelines

_A lightweight framework for LLM-based data transformation, data extraction and classification pipelines._

<hr>

Superpipe helps you build multi-step LLM pipelines and optimize them to find the right trade-off between **accuracy, cost, and speed**. Use Superpipe to:

1. Build the first version of your pipeline
2. Label some ground truth data to evaluate on
3. Try different techniques and parameters and evaluate them against each other with a hyperparameter search
4. Pick the technique and parameters that maximize your objective function

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed, then run

```
pip install superpipe-py
```

## Basic Usage
